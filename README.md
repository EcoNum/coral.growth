Coral reefs are considered one of the most biodiverse marine ecosystems
on the planet. Coral reefs host a large and various communities of
organisms such as fishes, echinoderms, plankton, etc. The coral reef is
a perfect example of the Darwin Paradox, i.e. it has a high productivity
when the available nutrients are low (oligotrophic seawater). The
protection of this ecosystem must be protected.

The study of the growth of the corals is a starting point to know the
health status of corals.

The goal of coral.growth package is to propose several functions and
examples datasets to study the growth of the coral.
