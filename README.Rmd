Coral reefs are considered one of the most biodiverse marine ecosystems on the planet. Coral reefs host a large and various communities of organisms such as fishes, echinoderms, plankton, etc. The coral reef is a perfect example of the Darwin Paradox, i.e. it has a high productivity when the available nutrients are low (oligotrophic seawater). The protection of this ecosystem must be protected. 

The study of the growth of the corals is a starting point to know the health status of corals. 

The goal of coral.growth package is to propose several functions and examples datasets to study the growth of the coral.
